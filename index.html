    <p3> short written responses about my experience interacting with Getty's website</p3>

    <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
  </body>The website's style caught my interest right away; I believe that strong colours are more visually appealing.
   Next, notice the font, graphics, colour palette, hero section, header, and homepage of the website. 
  Through directing navigation and interaction choices.It's critical to have easy navigation when utilising a website.

  <h3>I spent two minutes with the experience and created a list</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>the website offers a visually captivating experience with dynamic fonts</li>
      <li>mouse-responsive background pictures</li>
      <li>images and texts appear naturally as you scroll down</li>
      <li>background music starts when you visit the website</li>
      <li>small movement in the text when you move the cursor over thebuttons</li>
      <li>The final artworks appear as rectangle images that you can click.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My experience </h3>

    <p>
   
    When I initially visited the website, I was drawn in by its visual appeal.
    The orange colour immediately drew my attention, and as soon as I logged on, the music began.
    The majority of my time is spent figuring out which button to click. It took me some time to understand how the website functions.
    I can watch how the text and image change by moving my mouse. To be honest,
    when I visit the site. It gives me a fresh idea for a websiteâ€”one that is more than simply text. 
    and I'm eager to browse the website for longer. 
    When I browse the site, the fonts and background images move with my mouse movement.
    Additionally, as I scrolled down, more images gradually became apparent, gently encouraging me to view more.
    This gradual disclosure effectively conveys the interactive character of the website and invites more investigation
     by enticing viewers to keep interacting with it.

    </p>

    <h3>My feedback </h3>

    <p> The Getty website places elements such as images, videos, audio files, animations, and interactive elements.
    Improve the website's aesthetics. In particular, music enhances my enjoyment of a website, 
    giving it a more upscale and immersive feel. I like this website, but if I had to mention one dislike, 
    it could be that when I initially went on it, I was unaware that I could scroll, so I kept seeking for the menu button.
