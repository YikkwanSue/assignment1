    <h4>My feedback </h4>

    <p>
   
    When I initially visited the website, I was drawn in by its visual appeal.
    The orange colour immediately drew my attention, and as soon as I logged on, the music began.
    The majority of my time is spent figuring out which button to click. It took me some time to understand how the website functions.
    I can watch how the text and image change by moving my mouse. To be honest,
    when I visit the site. It gives me a fresh idea for a websiteâ€”one that is more than simply text. 
    and I'm eager to browse the website for longer. 
    When I browse the site, the fonts and background images move with my mouse movement.
    Additionally, as I scrolled down, more images gradually became apparent, gently encouraging me to view more.
    This gradual disclosure effectively conveys the interactive character of the website and invites more investigation
     by enticing viewers to keep interacting with it.
